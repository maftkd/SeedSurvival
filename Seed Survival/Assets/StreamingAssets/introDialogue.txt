Once upon a time, the Zen Forest was lush with life.%It was not long before man got in the way of that.%With a constant demand for more resources, man began to take more than give.%Humans chopped down every last tree until there were none left.%It wasn't long after the demise of the woods, that humanity would fall too.%You are the only survivor.%Your only possession is just one seed.
